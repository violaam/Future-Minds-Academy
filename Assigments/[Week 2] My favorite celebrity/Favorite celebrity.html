        <p> <b>Adele</b>, by name of Adele Laurie Blue Adkins, (born May 5, 1988, Tottenham, London, England), English
            pop
            singer and songwriter whose soulful emotive voice and traditionally crafted songs made her one of the most
            broadly popular performers of her generation.
            Adkins was raised by a young single mother in various working-class neighbourhoods of London. As a child,
            she
            enjoyed singing contemporary pop music and learned to play the guitar and the clarinet. However, it was not
            until her early teens, when she discovered rhythm-and-blues singer Etta James and other mid-20th-century
            performers, that she began to consider a musical career.</p>
