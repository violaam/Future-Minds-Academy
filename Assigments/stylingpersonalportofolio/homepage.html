            <img src="images/profilepic.jpg" alt="profile picture of Viola Maliqi" style="width:250px;height:250px;">
            <p>Meet Viola Maliqi from Gjilan, Kosovo. Viola pursued her studies in Primary Education at the
                University of Prishtina "Hasan Prishtina" and is currently working towards a master's degree in Science
                of
                Education. With a strong desire to inspire and empower young minds, Viola has chosen teaching as her
                true
                calling.

                As a second-grade teacher, Viola constantly seeks innovative teaching methods to create an engaging and
                interactive learning environment for her students. She believes in the power of technology and
                incorporates
                it into her lessons to enhance the educational experience. In fact, Viola's goal is to expand her
                knowledge
                in coding so that she can integrate it into her classroom and profession, providing her students with
                valuable skills for the future.

                Outside of the classroom, Viola indulges in hobbies that fuel her creativity. She enjoys photography,
                capturing beautiful moments and expressing her artistic side. Additionally, she loves exploring the
                great
                outdoors, finding inspiration in nature's wonders.
