        <h2>Who is Viola Maliqi?</h2>
        <img src="images/profilepic.jpg" alt="profile picture of Viola Maliqi" style="width:250px;height:250px;">
        <p>Meet Viola Maliqi from Gjilan, Kosovo. Viola pursued her studies in Primary Education at the
            University of Prishtina "Hasan Prishtina" and is currently working towards a master's degree in Science of
            Education. With a strong desire to inspire and empower young minds, Viola has chosen teaching as her true
            calling.

            As a second-grade teacher, Viola constantly seeks innovative teaching methods to create an engaging and
            interactive learning environment for her students. She believes in the power of technology and incorporates
            it into her lessons to enhance the educational experience. In fact, Viola's goal is to expand her knowledge
            in coding so that she can integrate it into her classroom and profession, providing her students with
            valuable skills for the future.

            Outside of the classroom, Viola indulges in hobbies that fuel her creativity. She enjoys photography,
            capturing beautiful moments and expressing her artistic side. Additionally, she loves exploring the great
            outdoors, finding inspiration in nature's wonders.
